# Hello! I'm Kashirada.

## 🧑🏼‍💻 Me

I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for clean code, creative design, and continuous learning.  
My main weapons are **Java**, **Python**, and **CSS**, but I love exploring new stacks and tools that push my limits.  

Outside of tech, I train in **Boxing** and **Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu** — disciplines that taught me focus, resilience, and precision, qualities I bring into every line of code.  

As a **multilingual developer**, I believe communication is as powerful as code itself.  
Always learning. Always building. Always evolving.

Oh, and yes... **I use Arch btw.** <img align="center" alt="Rafa-Python" height="30" width="40" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/linux/linux-original.svg">

## 🛠️ My Toolbox

**When I'm coding:**
- ☕ Java — for when things need to be robust
- 🐍 Python — my go-to for quick scripts and automation
- ⚡ JavaScript — making the web come alive
- 🌐 HTML5 & 🎨 CSS3 — the classics never go out of style

**When I'm designing:**
- 🖌️ Photoshop — for those pixel-perfect moments
- 🎨 Figma — collaborative design magic
- 🪄 Canva — quick graphics when I need 'em

**My daily drivers:**
- 🗂️ Notion — my second brain
- 🧑‍💻 VS Code — where the magic happens
- 🐧 Arch Linux — because I like my OS like I like my coffee: minimal and customizable

## 🌍 Languages I Speak

Language is just another form of architecture — and I love building bridges between them.  
I'm a **native Portuguese speaker** and **fluent in English**, currently studying **Japanese**, **Russian**, **German**, **Italian**, and **French**.
